The weekly methane images from February 2019 to December 2021 are contained in the folder “Images”.

# Image Interpolation
Missing data in the images were filled using the Inverse Weighted Distance (IDW) interpolation method and are stored in the folder “Interpolated”. Note that IDW was not applied to all pixels, but only those that are missing to preserve the original pixel values where we can. In addition, this process was only applied to images from January to April and November to December because cloud cover during the monsoon season (May to October) obscures Bangladesh.
